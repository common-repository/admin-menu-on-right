Moves WordPress admin menu to the right side of the screen.

== Description ==

The default position for the menu in WordPress 2.7 is on the left, but since the scroll-bar is on the right, some people wanted the menu over there too. Plus a lot of blogs/websites have menus on the right so menu on the right seems to be a pretty popular option.

This plug-in moves WordPress admin menu to the right side of the screen. 

== Installation ==

This plug-in is easy to install and requires no changes to settings or code.

1. Upload `admin-menu-on-right` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Or, you can use the installer that is part of WordPress 2.7
